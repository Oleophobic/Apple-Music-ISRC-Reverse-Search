# Apple-Music-ISRC-Reverse-Search for catalog IDs
This is my first script, with the help of AI (Chat GPT &amp; Google BARD)
a python script which allows you to read ALAC files for metadata related to individual track ISRCs
First reads the current folder for .m4a files then reads files for ISRCs, this will then take your Auth and Media Tokens then reverse seacrch for coresponding song IDs
ID's are writen to a text file with the coresponding file name.
From there other scripts can be made to use Apple Musics extensive API for relevent song or album information
